Introduction
=============

Super Grub2 Disk needs to be tested to see if EFI mode was builtin in it or not. So you need a virtual machine with an EFI capable boot firmware (not sure of the right technical name).

Virtualbox
==========
    Select Virtual machine
    Settings
    System
    Enable EFI (only special OS)
    OK 

KVM and Ovmf
============
This is to force an EFI-only system so that you know that it actually works.
Requisites

apt-get install kvm ovmf

Test KVM and Ovmf
